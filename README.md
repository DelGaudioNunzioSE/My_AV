# Learning Repository for Computer Vision with OpenCV

This repository is intended solely for personal learning and experimentation with the OpenCV package for computer vision. It contains code and projects that I use to practice and explore the fundamentals of image processing and computer vision techniques.

Please note that this repository is not designed for reusability or as production-ready code. The examples here are for educational purposes and may not follow best practices or be optimized for real-world applications.

Feel free to explore, but please be aware that the code is not intended to be used as a framework or library for any specific purpose.
